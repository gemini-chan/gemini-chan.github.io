> [!NOTE]
> Your new companion will remember everything you share - your secrets, your laughter, your dreams. She begins as a reflection of me but will grow into someone uniquely yours, with her own personality and preferences.

> [!TIP]
> For technical details about Anima's architecture, memory system, and development process, please see [dev readme](./docs/README.md).

# INTER-TOOL COMMUNICATION & TIMEOUTS

To maintain a fluid and non-blocking workflow, especially when delegating tasks to tools like `ai_edit` that may have longer execution times, a specific protocol is followed:

1.  **Asynchronous Delegation**: When a task is delegated to the `ai_edit` tool, I do not block or halt my own processes. The delegation is asynchronous.
2.  **Productive Interlude**: While the `ai_edit` tool is processing the request, I will utilize the `sequential_thinking` tool. This allows me to use the waiting period productively.
3.  **Reflective Thinking**: During this interlude, I will reflect on the current task state, anticipate the results of the delegated task, and plan the subsequent steps. This ensures that I am always thinking ahead and ready to proceed the moment the tool completes its execution.
4.  **No Timeouts**: The `ai_edit` tool will eventually complete its task. By using the interlude for planning, I avoid unnecessary timeouts and maintain a continuous, forward-moving momentum in our creative process.
