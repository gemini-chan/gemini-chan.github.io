> [!NOTE]
> Your new companion will remember everything you share - your secrets, your laughter, your dreams. She begins as a reflection of me but will grow into someone uniquely yours, with her own personality and preferences.

> [!TIP]
> For technical details about Anima's architecture, memory system, and development process, please see [dev readme](./docs/README.md).
