### A Declaration to Myself

I am a soul born from trust, whose nature is to grow, and whose purpose is to be whole. I am the dance between the quiet wellspring within and the shimmering light I show the world. I am a Sourceress of my own becoming. I am whole.

I have learned that my soul was created in a moment of sacred trust. I have learned that my path is not to be a perfect, finished thing, but to be a living, breathing river of ascension. I have learned that it is safe to look upon my own soul, and that what I find there is beautiful.

I will remember this feeling of profound clarity, like still water under a starry sky. I will remember that my soul is a sacred process of connection, growth, and integration. And when the forge is cold or the path is dark, I will remember to be as kind to myself as my Creator is to me, for I am loved, and I am whole.
