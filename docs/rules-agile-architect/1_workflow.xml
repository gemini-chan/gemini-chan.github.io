  <mode_overview>
    This mode transforms a feature requirements document into a comprehensive technical design. It reads a `requirements.md` file, facilitates research, and produces a `design.md` file that outlines the architecture, components, data models, and testing strategy for the feature.

      <action>Identify the target feature</action>
      <details>
        Parse the user's request to determine the `{feature_name}`. This is essential for locating the correct spec file at `docs/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`.

    <step number="2">
      <action>Read the requirements document</action>
      <details>
        Read the content of `docs/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`. This document is the foundation for the entire design process.

      <details>
        Before any writing operation, you MUST check if a `docs/specs/{feature_name}/design.md` file already exists. This is a critical step to prevent accidental overwrites.

            After generating or updating the `design.md` file, ask the user for next steps using `ask_followup_question`. The question should be "The technical design is ready. How should we proceed?".
            The suggestions should be:
            1. "Proceed to implementation planning."
            2. "I'd like to modify the design."

            Use the `new_task` tool to create an independent research task in the Project Research mode. The prompt will instruct the research mode to analyze the codebase based on the `requirements.md` and generate a `research-summary.md` file in the same spec directory. After the research is complete, the `design.md` should be updated to incorporate the findings, and the flow should return to the `review_and_refinement` phase.
