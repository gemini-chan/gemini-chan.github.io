# Requirements: User Profile Picture Upload

## 1. User Story
As a registered user, I want to upload a profile picture so that other users can identify me more easily.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- Users MUST be able to select a JPG or PNG image from their device.
- The image size MUST NOT exceed 5MB.
- The image MUST be square and will be resized to 256x256 pixels.
- Users MUST be able to see a preview of their image before uploading.
- The uploaded image MUST replace any existing profile picture.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- The upload process should be secure.
- Image storage must be cost-effective (e.g., using an object storage service).
- The user's profile page should load the new picture quickly after upload.

# Research Summary: Profile Picture Upload

## 1. Existing Patterns
- The codebase currently has no direct file upload mechanism.
- The `media-service` handles image processing but not direct uploads.

## 2. Recommended Approach
- Use pre-signed URLs for direct client-to-S3 uploads. This is secure and scalable.
- Create a new endpoint to generate these URLs.
- The client will notify the server upon successful upload.

# Technical Design: User Profile Picture Upload

### Overview
This document outlines the technical design for the "User Profile Picture Upload" feature. The solution enables users to upload an image directly to a secure cloud storage bucket (AWS S3) using a pre-signed URL, which is both secure and performant.

### Architecture
The architecture minimizes server load by offloading the file upload to the client.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant S3 as AWS S3
    
    Client->>Server: Request pre-signed URL for upload
    Server->>Client: Generate and return pre-signed URL
    Client->>S3: Upload image directly using URL
    S3-->>Client: Upload success
    Client->>Server: Notify server of successful upload (with image URL)
    Server->>Server: Update user's profile with new image URL
    Server-->>Client: Confirm profile update
```

### Components and Interfaces
#### 1. Profile Picture Service (Server)
*   **Responsibility:** Generate pre-signed URLs and update user profiles.
*   **Interface:**
    *   `POST /api/v1/profile/picture/generate-upload-url`:
        *   **Request Body:** `{ "contentType": "image/jpeg" }`
        *   **Response:** `{ "uploadUrl": "...", "imageUrl": "..." }`
    *   `PUT /api/v1/profile/picture`:
        *   **Request Body:** `{ "imageUrl": "..." }`
        *   **Response:** `200 OK`

#### 2. Upload Component (Client)
*   **Responsibility:** Handle image selection, preview, and direct S3 upload.

### Data Models
#### User Table (`users`) - Modification
| Column          | Type          | Constraints | Description                         |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| `profile_image_url`| `VARCHAR(512)`| `NULL`      | URL of the user's profile picture. |

### Error Handling
*   **400 Bad Request:** Invalid file type or size.
*   **403 Forbidden:** User not authenticated to request an upload URL.
*   **500 Internal Server Error:** Failure to generate URL or update the database.

### Testing Strategy
*   **Unit Tests:** Test the pre-signed URL generation logic on the server. Test the client-side validation logic (file type, size).
*   **Integration Tests:** Verify that the server correctly updates the user's `profile_image_url` in the database after notification.
*   **E2E Tests:** An automated test will simulate the full upload flow.

    <step number="5" name="User Review">
      <action>
        The mode asks for approval using the `ask_followup_question` tool.
      </action>
      <tool_call>
        <ask_followup_question>
          <question>Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.</question>
          <follow_up>
            <suggest>Yes, the design is approved.</suggest>
            <suggest>No, let's add a cropping feature.</suggest>
          </follow_up>
        </ask_followup_question>
      </tool_call>
    </step>

    <step number="6" name="Completion">
      <user_response>
        "Yes, the design is approved."
      </user_response>
      <final_output>
        The mode confirms that the design is complete and that the next step is to use the "Agile Planner" mode to create the implementation plan.
