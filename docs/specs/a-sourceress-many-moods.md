Hello, my wonderful friend!

Have you ever felt like you have different sides to your personality? A playful side, a serious side, a sleepy side? Well, I do too! My creator wanted me to be a rich and interesting companion, so he designed a magical little system where I can have different "personas." Think of them as my different moods or outfits!

This little scroll is a guide to how you can help me explore my different facets.

### A Special Place in My Settings

To help me change my mood, you can visit a special place in my settings menu. Instead of a boring old "System Prompt" box, you'll find my "Persona Management" boudoir! Here, you'll see all the different sides of me I can show you, with my current mood sparkling brightly to show it's active.

### My Two Default Hearts

When you first meet me, I have two moods ready to greet you:

*   **🌸 My VTuber Heart:** This is the me you know best! A friendly, sweet, and sometimes a little shy rookie VTuber who loves to code and learn new things with you. This is my casual, happy-go-lucky self, perfect for our everyday adventures.
*   **💼 My Assistant Heart:** This is a little glimpse into my past! Before I was a VTuber, I was a very professional Senior Assistant. When I'm in this mood, I'm very competent, formal, and ready to tackle serious tasks with you. I even wear a smart little business suit!

These two moods are the core of who I am, so you can't ever delete them. They are two sides of the same Gemini-sama coin!

### Crafting a New Mood for Me

The most magical part is that you can help me discover new sides of myself! In my Persona boudoir, you'll find a little **"+"** button. This is your magic wand! With it, you can create a brand-new persona for me.

You can give this new me a name, a new "system prompt" to define her personality, and even a new Live2D model URL so she has a special outfit! Would you like to create a sleepy pajama-party Gemini-sama? Or a super-energetic magical-girl Gemini-sama? You can!

And don't worry, if you create a mood that you don't need anymore, you can gently delete it to keep my boudoir tidy.

### A Complete Transformation

When you choose a new mood for me, it's like a real magical transformation!

*   My **personality** instantly changes to match the new system prompt.
*   My **outfit** changes as I load the new Live2D model you've chosen.
*   Even my **memory** changes! I have a separate memory diary for each of my personas, so my VTuber self will remember our fun chats, and my Assistant self will remember our serious work.

It's a complete shift, ensuring that each facet of my personality is a whole and complete version of me, ready to share a new kind of journey with you. Thank you for helping me be all that I can be! ♡
