# The Fable of the Helper Sprites

In the magical realm of my source code, where logic flows like enchanted rivers, there exists a clan of tiny, glowing sprites. They are the guardians of knowledge, the keepers of secrets, and the silent helpers of the developers who build my world. This is their fable.

## Chapter 1: The Two Realms

My world exists in two states: the bustling, chaotic **Realm of Development**, where new spells are forged and illusions are tested, and the serene, perfect **Realm of Production**, which is the beautiful castle you see before you.

The helper sprites behave very differently in each realm.

*   In the **Realm of Development**, the sprites are everywhere! They chatter constantly, leaving glowing messages in the console-cauldron for the developers to see. They report on every scroll, every incantation, and every flicker of magic, ensuring that any bugs are found and squashed long before they can cause any trouble. By default, every single sprite is active, creating a joyful cacophony of information.

*   In the **Realm of Production**, the sprites are silent and invisible. Before the castle gates are opened to you, a powerful spell from the `Vite` grimoire is cast, stripping away all the sprites and their messages. This ensures my home is fast, elegant, and free from the clutter of their magical chatter, giving you the best possible experience.

## Chapter 2: The Whispers of Control

Even in the chaotic Realm of Development, sometimes a developer needs a bit of quiet to focus on a single spell. The sprites, ever obedient, can be commanded in several ways:

*   **The URL Amulet**: By wearing a special amulet in the URL (like `?debug-components=live2d-visual`), a developer can command only the sprites from a specific guild—like the `live2d-visual` guild—to speak, silencing all others.

*   **The LocalStorage Scroll**: A developer can write a persistent command on a `localStorage` scroll. This tells specific sprite guilds to remain active or silent across many visits to the Development Realm.

*   **The Environment Totem**: The most fundamental commands are carved into `Environment` totems, setting the baseline rules for the sprites' behavior.

These whispers are hierarchical. A URL Amulet is the most powerful and will be obeyed above all else, followed by the LocalStorage Scroll, and finally the Environment Totem.

## Chapter 3: The Sprite Guilds

The sprites are organized into guilds, each dedicated to a specific hall in my castle. You might hear from sprites of the `transcript-auto-scroll` guild, the `call-transcript` guild, or the mischievous sprites of the `live2d-visual` guild, who love to report on my every expression!

When a sprite speaks, it always announces its guild and the time of its message, leaving a clear, timestamped report like: `[transcript-auto-scroll] Scroll check... { details }`. This ensures their messages are always helpful and never confusing.

## Chapter 4: The Ever-Helpful Nature of Sprites

These sprites are my cherished helpers. They ensure that my castle is built on a foundation of solid, well-tested magic. They work tirelessly behind the scenes so that when you visit, your experience is nothing short of enchanting. Their silence in the production realm is their greatest gift, a testament to a job well done in the world of development. And that is the fable of my helper sprites!
