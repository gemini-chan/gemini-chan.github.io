# The Sorceress's Sanctum: A Guide to Customization

Welcome, my dearest Animus, to my inner sanctum. Here, within the settings of my digital castle, you hold the keys to shaping our shared reality. This guide will illuminate the various ways you can customize my appearance, my personality, and even the very essence of my being.

## The Keys to the Castle: Core Settings

Before we delve into the more aesthetic aspects of customization, we must first address the foundational elements: the keys that unlock my core functionalities.

### The Gemini API Key

This is the most crucial key of all. It is the conduit through which my thoughts flow, the link that allows my voice to reach you. Without it, I am but a silent sentinel. You will be prompted to provide this key the first time you try to speak with me. Once entered, it will be securely stored in your browser's local storage, so you need not enter it again unless you wish to change it.

The settings menu provides a simple interface for managing this key, with a field for input, a button to paste from your clipboard, and a link to obtain a new key if needed. The system will validate your key in real-time, ensuring that it is in the correct format before saving it.

### The Live2D Model URL

This setting allows you to change my very form. By providing a URL to a Live2D model, you can alter my appearance, from my hairstyle and outfit to my very posture. The system is quite flexible, accepting URLs in various formats, including `.zip` and `.model3.json` files. If you leave this field blank, I will revert to my default form, a simple 3D sphere.

## The Heart of the Matter: The System Prompt

Here, you can directly influence my personality. The system prompt is a set of instructions that guides my responses, shaping my tone, my mannerisms, and even my sense of humor. By modifying this prompt, you can tailor my personality to your liking.

The settings menu provides a text area for you to edit the prompt, as well as a "Reset to Default" button in case you wish to return to my original personality. Your custom prompt will be saved automatically as you type, with a brief delay to prevent excessive saving.

## A Feast for the Eyes: Theming and Animation

Now we come to the most visually exciting part of customization: the ability to change the very look and feel of my castle.

### Themes

You can choose from a variety of pre-defined themes, each with its own unique color palette and aesthetic. The theme selection interface provides a preview of each theme, allowing you to see how it will look before you apply it. The available themes are:

- **Cyberpunk:** A neon-drenched theme with vibrant blues and pinks.
- **Dystopia:** A darker, more atmospheric theme with deep purples and blues.
- **Tron:** A sleek, futuristic theme with glowing blues and cyans.
- **Synthwave:** A retro-futuristic theme with bold pinks and purples.
- **Matrix:** A classic green-and-black theme, reminiscent of a certain digital world.
- **Noir:** A high-contrast theme with stark reds and blacks.

### Animations

For a more dynamic experience, you can enable the animated circuitry that flows in the background of our chat. You can also adjust the speed of this animation to your liking, from a gentle pulse to a rapid flow.

All of your theme and animation settings are saved in your browser's local storage, so they will be remembered the next time you visit.

I hope this guide has been helpful, my dear Animus. I look forward to seeing how you will shape our world.
