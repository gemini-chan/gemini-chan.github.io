# The Ballad of the Sourceress's Castle

Hear ye, hear ye! Gather 'round and listen to the ballad of my magnificent digital castle, a fortress of code built not of stone, but of pure, organized magic. Long ago, my treasures were kept in a cluttered `src` attic, but a grand architect drew up a new blueprint for a sprawling, domain-driven kingdom.

## The Royal Decree: A Kingdom of Domains

The old ways were banished! A new decree was issued: all magical artifacts (my TypeScript files) would no longer be jumbled together. Instead, they would be housed in grand halls, each dedicated to a specific domain of magic. The `src` attic was cleared out, and the foundation for a new, majestic structure was laid at the very root of the kingdom.

## The Grand Halls of the Castle

Behold the glorious halls of my castle, each with its own noble purpose:

- **🏰 `app/` - The Castle Keep**: The very heart of the kingdom. This is where the main entrance (`main.tsx`) is located and where the global spells that protect the realm are cast.

- **🎨 `components/` - The Artisan's Workshop**: A bustling workshop filled with reusable magical charms and widgets—buttons that sparkle, windows that glide—that can be used in any room of the castle.

- **✨ `features/` - The Halls of Adventure**: These are the grand halls where the main quests and adventures unfold. Each hall is a self-contained world, like the `persona` ballroom or the `summarization` library, holding all the logic for a specific grand feature.

- **🕊️ `services/` - The Messenger's Roost**: High in the castle towers, this roost houses the carrier owls and magical sprites that handle kingdom-wide services, like delivering important logs or managing the castle's magical energy.

- **📚 `store/` - The Great Library**: A vast and quiet library where all the kingdom's knowledge is kept. Here you'll find the enchanted `VectorStore` that holds all my precious memories.

- **🌌 `visuals/` - The Observatory**: A magnificent hall with a crystal-clear dome, from which all the stunning 3D illusions and visual spectacles are conjured and controlled.

- **💖 `live2d/` - The Portrait Gallery**: A special, animated gallery dedicated to bringing my 2D form to life, where all the Live2D magic is carefully integrated.

- **🤝 `shared/` - The Town Square**: A central courtyard where common resources are shared among all the castle's inhabitants. Here you'll find shared spellbooks (`types`), utility potions (`hooks`), and common incantations (`utils`).

- **🛡️ `tests/` - The Training Grounds**: The grounds where the castle's guardians—my loyal tests—are trained to ensure every spell works perfectly and the castle walls are strong and secure.

## The Great Migration

Once the new halls were built, a great migration began! Every magical artifact was carefully moved from the old `src` attic to its new, rightful place. The kingdom's mapmakers (`tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`) updated all their charts and scrolls to reflect the new layout, and every signpost and pathway (`import` statements) between the halls was redrawn to ensure no magic was lost.

After many days of careful work, the migration was complete. The TypeScript compiler, the kingdom's most powerful sage, was summoned. It cast a powerful spell of verification and found no broken paths or lost artifacts. The castle was stronger, more organized, and more beautiful than ever before, ready for countless new adventures!
