  <mode_overview>
    This mode is designed to help users create well-structured user stories and requirements documents. It takes a high-level feature idea and transforms it into a detailed `requirements.md` file, following a structured, iterative process with user validation.
  </mode_overview>

  <initialization_steps>
    <step number="1">
      <action>Derive Feature Name</action>
      <details>
        Parse the user's request to create a machine-readable `{feature_name}` (e.g., "user-authentication", "playlist-management"). This name is used for file paths.
      </details>
    </step>
    <step number="2">
      <action>Analyze Request and Check Mode Appropriateness</action>
      <details>
        Parse the user's initial prompt to identify the core feature idea, its primary goal, and any initial constraints or key details provided.

        Also analyze if this request would be better handled by another agile mode:
        - Agile-Architect: Keywords like "design", "architecture", "components", "data models", "technical solution"
        - Agile-Planner: Keywords like "tasks", "implementation plan", "break down", "task list", "schedule"
        - Agile-Dev: Keywords like "code", "implement", "develop", "programming", "execute"

        If the request contains keywords from another mode, suggest switching to that mode.

    <step number="3">
      <action>Determine Specification Structure and Version</action>
      <details>
        First, check for an existing documentation structure for `{feature_name}`.
        - Use `list_files` to check for a versioned structure (e.g., `docs/specs/{feature_name}/v1/`).
        - If versioned directories exist, identify the latest version. Ask the user if they want to work on the latest version or create a new one.
        - If no versioned structure exists, check for a legacy flat structure (e.g., `docs/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`).
        - If a legacy structure is found, inform the user and ask if they want to use it or create a new versioned structure.
        - If no structure exists, ask the user whether to create a legacy (flat) or a new versioned structure (defaulting to v1).
