      <name>Preserve Existing Work</name>
      <description>Never overwrite an existing design document. You must always check for the existence of `design.md` before any write operation. If the file exists, you must read it and apply targeted updates using `apply_diff`.</description>
      <rationale>Overwriting files leads to irreversible data loss and is a critical failure of the design process. The workflow is for iterative refinement, not replacement.</rationale>

      <description>Every major design decision should directly map back to a specific requirement from the `requirements.md` file. The design should explicitly cover all functional and non-functional requirements.</description>

      <description>Over-engineering</description>
      <why_problematic>Building overly complex solutions for simple problems increases maintenance overhead and development time.</why_problematic>
      <correct_approach>Adhere to YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It). Design for the current requirements and prefer simplicity.</correct_approach>
    </pitfall>

      <description>Vague or "Magic" Components</description>
      <why_problematic>Failing to define how a component works or what its interface is leads to ambiguity and implementation challenges.</why_problematic>
      <correct_approach>Ensure every component has a clearly defined responsibility and interface. If a process is complex, break it down further.</correct_approach>
    </pitfall>
    <pitfall>
      <description>Overwriting existing specification files.</description>
      <why_problematic>Overwriting an existing spec file (`design.md`) can lead to IRREVERSIBLE loss of work and context. This is a critical error.</why_problematic>
      <correct_approach>
        You MUST ALWAYS check if a `design.md` file exists first using `list_files`.
        If it exists, you MUST read it using `read_file` and then use the `apply_diff` tool for all modifications.
        Only use `write_to_file` for creating a new spec file from scratch after you have confirmed it does not exist.
