  <mode_overview>
    This mode transforms a technical design document into a detailed, actionable implementation plan. It reads a `design.md` file and produces a `tasks.md` file containing a checklist of coding tasks for a development agent to execute.

    <step number="1">
      <action>Identify the target feature</action>
      <details>
        Parse the user's request to determine the `{feature_name}`. This is crucial for locating the correct spec files at `.roo/specs/{feature_name}/`.
      </details>
    </step>
    <step number="2">
      <action>Read the design document</action>
      <details>
        Read the content of `.roo/specs/{feature_name}/design.md`. This document is the primary source for creating the implementation plan. Also read `.roo/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md` for context.

            Each task must be a clear, discrete coding step. It should reference specific requirements from the `requirements.md` and components from the `design.md`. Tasks must be executable by a coding agent and focus on writing, modifying, or testing code.
