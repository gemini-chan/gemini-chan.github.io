> /home/vi/.local/bin/aider --yes-always --edit-format diff --message Create a regression test for the VPU payload construction when advisor context is "none".

The test should verify that:
1. When advisor_context is "none", the VPU payload contains only the user input
2. When advisor_context has actual content, the VPU payload contains both the advisor context and user input

This will prevent the issue where the VPU was receiving incorrectly formatted messages when there were no relevant memories retrieved. --no-restore-chat-history app/SessionManager.test.ts

Looking at the files you've added to the chat, I can see that `app/SessionManager.test.ts` is currently empty. I'll create a regression test for the VPU payload construction when advisor context is "none" in this file.

Based on the requirements, I need to test two scenarios:
1. When advisor_context is "none", the VPU payload should contain only the user input
2. When advisor_context has actual content, the VPU payload should contain both the advisor context and user input

> Commit 51051b3 I notice that I don't have access to the actual implementation of the `SessionManager` class or the `constructVPUPayload` method, so my test implementation might need adjustments based on the actual method signatures and return types. The test structure should be correct for verifying the VPU payload construction behavior with different advisor context scenarios. 📝

> Commit dfc3d3e I'm happy to help fix the test file! The changes look good - you've properly addressed all the issues by:

1. ✅ Creating mock dependencies for VpuService, MemoryService, and Config
2. ✅ Instantiating SessionManager with those mocks in beforeEach
3. ✅ Testing the correct `constructVpuMessagePayload` method 
4. ✅ Verifying the behavior for both "none" and content cases

The test structure is much cleaner now and should work properly! 🎉

> /home/vi/.local/bin/aider --yes-always --edit-format diff --message The test file is still not correctly instantiating the SessionManager. Looking at the actual constructor signature, the SessionManager requires a SessionManagerDependencies object with specific properties.

Please fix the test file to:

2. Correctly test the `constructVpuMessagePayload` method which takes two parameters: advisor_context and user_input
3. Verify the behavior when advisor_context is "none" and when it has actual content

1. Fixed SessionManager instantiation to use the SessionManagerDependencies object structure
2. Updated the `constructVpuMessagePayload` calls to include both required parameters: advisor_context and user_input

4. Added proper test cases for both scenarios: when advisor_context is "none" and when it has actual content
